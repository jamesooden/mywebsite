James Olin Oden is a dynamic singer/songwriter from Raleigh, NC who plays a vast 
collection of stirring Scottish, Irish, English and original songs inspired by 
Celtic and Americana traditions. A passionate storyteller and captivating 
instrumentalist, he leads us through a musical journey that spans the globe 
and the epochs of time, with infectious rhythms paying reverent gratitude to 
the forefathers of folk, flamenco and Appalachian music. Like whiskey warming 
the soul, his deep, resonant voice is rich with character and his guitar, 
tin whistle, bones and bodhran (Irish drum) playing is both thrilling and 
evocative. Fast-paced foot stompers lay gracefully alongside heart-rending airs 
and ballads, weaving a tapestry of acoustic eloquence that will sweep you 
away to the lands of legend.

As a member of the Friendly Fiddlers, the Gypsy Rovers, and the Irish Wolfhounds, 
James absorbed ancient songbooks bursting with enchanting stories that cried 
out for retelling and augments them with his own compelling originals filled 
with dark introspection and silly revelry. Careening between sensitive 
wedding chapel ballads, bawdy pub singalongs and everything in between, he 
creates an authentic and engaging musical experience custom tailored for 
each occasion. From the classic yearning sounds of the old-time originators 
to modern day influences that light a fire under your dancing shoes, listeners 
are swept away on an expedition through the evolution of music. As James says, 
“My hope is that, as my heart is moved by the music, so too may yours be moved.”

"James Olin Oden’s folk sound on Samhain’s March reminds 
heavily of great tavern or pub music that can warm the soul 
just like a nice glass of whiskey."

"James Olin Oden brings a feeling of the British Isles to 
North Carolina with his stirring vocals and evocative 
guitar  accompaniment, interspersed with bodhran (Irish drum) and 
tin whistle playing. Pulling from a vast collection of 
Scottish, Irish, English, and self composed songs, he weaves 
a tapestry of acoustic eloquence that will whisk you away to 
the land of your dreams. James brings a sensitivity and feeling 
to his performance that you can't help but be drawn into. I 
have seen him perform from small home venues to large crowds 
and in every setting he seems to know how to fit his
performance to the demands of the space and audience. 
James provides an authentic and engaging musical experience 
that is custom tailored to your specific requirements. 
From the sensitive ballad in a wedding chapel, to the bawdy, 
rowdy drinking singalong, James provides everything he does 
with a deep passion. If you're looking for Irish, or Celtic 
inspired entertainment for any occasion, be sure to 
give James a call. You will definitely be satisfied."
